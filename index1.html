  Let the chalice reveal the tomb of the gods; let blood be the hunter's nourishment.

...And let ye partake in communion...
  
  Visitor… Moon-scented hunter… I am Annalise, Queen of Castle Cainhurst. Ruler of the Vilebloods, and sworn enemy of the church. Yet, Our people are murdered, and We are prisoner to this wretched mask. What is it thou’rt in search of?
  
  

    Laurence: “Master Willem, I've come to bid you farewell.”

    Master Willem: “Oh, I know, I know. You think now, to betray me.”

    Laurence:“No, but you will never listen. I tell you, I will not forget our adage.”

    Master Willem: “...We are born of the blood, made men by the blood, undone by the blood. Our eyes are yet to open..."

    Master Willem & Laurence: "Fear the old blood."

    Laurence: “I must take my leave.”

    Master Willem: “By the gods, fear it, Laurence."

  
    "Ahh, Kos, or some say Kosm... Do you hear our prayers?"
    "No, we shall not abandon the dream."
    "No one can catch us! No one can stop us now! [cackling]."
    "Ah hah hah ha! Ooh! Majestic! A hunter is a hunter, even in a dream. But, alas, not too fast! The nightmare swirls and churns unending!"
    "As you once did for the vacuous Rom, grant us eyes, grant us eyes. Plant eyes on our brains, to cleanse our beastly idiocy."
    "The grand lake of mud, hidden now, from sight."
    "The cosmos, of course!"
    "Let us sit about, and speak feverishly. Chatting into the wee hours of..."
    "New ideas, of the higher plane!"
    "Now I'm waking up, I'll forget everything..."

  
  让圣杯显现众神的坟墓，让血成为猎人的养分，让汝等参与圣餐。
